Lacking the conditions to thrive, decentralized technology could use a boost for security &amp; privacy. Few ideas to help give it a push. Idea is to not undermine the existing LEGAL authority for law enforcement to do their jobs.

I believe the original intent with the justification for higher costs for small busineses was due to static IP addresses. With IPv6, this shouldn't be that big of a deal. If we had faster upload speeds for SMB's, similar to that of fiber, then a good portion of the nation could benefit from selling unused storage/compute on their existing hardware. I have sold servers before to customers that had 4-5 computers. A $60 server would have worked using open source - but requirements usually call for at least a SFF/Micro server. Domain services typically use up about 2% CPU, 20-30% of 8gb of RAM, and 20gb / 1TB minimum HDD.
