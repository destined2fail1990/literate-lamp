Lacking the conditions to thrive, decentralized technology could use a boost for security &amp; privacy. Few ideas to help give it a push. Idea is to not undermine the existing LEGAL authority for law enforcement to do their jobs.


# Infrastructure: FCC - Cable - Businesses
I believe the original intent with the justification for higher costs for small busineses was due to static IP addresses. With IPv6, this shouldn't be that big of a deal. If we had faster upload speeds for SMB's, similar to that of fiber, then a good portion of the nation could benefit from selling unused storage/compute on their existing hardware. I have sold servers before to customers that had 4-5 computers. A $60 server would have worked using open source - but requirements usually call for at least a SFF/Micro server. Windows Server + Domain services typically use up about 2% CPU, 20-30% of 8gb of RAM, and 20gb / 1TB minimum HDD. Could offset the wage increase? If SMB's did not have one.

# Another look at grid storage/computing throughout a local network - shared resources to be sold to a larger network?
Grid storage is essentially a RAID set up over the network, if you abstract the communication between the nodes. Newer algorithms may exist that work better.

Basic Example:

You have 13 computers. Each computer has 100gb of storage reserved for the cluster. For every 1 drive, there is 1 redundant (can be scaled up or down), so you end up with 600gb of additional redundant storage that would otherwise go unused. If PC's are offline, WoL can wake them up. Typically, the setup consistents of 1 of 4-6 PC's in an enterprise environment used for redundancy I believe.
